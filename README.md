# GenSpark-Client-Project-Case-Study
This project is a full stack client-project management system.<br /> <br />
Clients have projects assigned to them and agreements that have been signed.
Basic authentication is included.

Each client can have many projects, each project can belong to only one client.

The Front-End portion has been built with ReactJS.<br />

Much of the heavy lifting is being implemented in react so that I can better understand it.
